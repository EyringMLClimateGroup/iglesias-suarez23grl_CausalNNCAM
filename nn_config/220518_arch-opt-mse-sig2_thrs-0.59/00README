Description:
    - This 00README file describes how the "models_arch-opt-mse-sig2_thrs-0.59" case was designed.

Procedure (followed for each output):
    - Threshold (0.59; single threshold for all outputs). Method:
        Analysis folder: "notebooks_threshold_optimization"
        Based only on 992hPa for dT/dt and dQ/dt with Rasp et al. architecture, since it where the Causally-inflormed-NNs seemed to struggle (performance) the most compared to ref cases. Only using dT/dt & dQ/dt since 2Ds fields are only diagnostics once coupled to CAM. 
        - Condition-1: R2_causalNN-thr_ => R2_singleNN_ <--> R2_SingleNN_ > 0
        - Condition-2: max(thr)
        - Evaluation** (_R2_): _Causally-informed-NNs (pc-a:0.01; thr[quantile-based]:0.59) with Rasp et al. architecture_ perform as good as the ref cases (incl. generalization).
    
    - Architecture optimized using SHERPA as follows:
    
        Analysis folder: "notebooks_evaluate_SHERPA_cases_loss-mse"
        Script: loss_vs_complexity_SHERPA_study.ipynb
        Config: 
            SHE_alg    = 'GridSearch'
            method     = 'sig'
            sig        = 2

            ## Explore num. of hidden layers and num. of nodes (per layer) with a fixed quantile-thrs (.59)
            # SHE_path   = f'./hyperparameter_tuning_{SHE_alg}_SHERPA/'
            # SHE_date   = '20220327_

        * Note that the arch-opt is then used for SingleNNs.
